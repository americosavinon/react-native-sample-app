 While the consumer waits for a visit to start, the server may suggest a new provider for the consumer to transfer to if available after a configurable wait time.

 @discussion If a suggested visit transfer is offered, the consumer can either accept the transfer by calling [AWSDKVisitTransfer acceptTransfer:] or decline the transfer by calling declineTransfer to
 remain waiting for the current provider. If the consumer accepts the transfer, a new AWSDKVisitContext or AWSDKVisit will be populated for the new provider depending on if quick transfer is
 supported. See [AWSDKVisitTransfer acceptTransfer:] for more details.

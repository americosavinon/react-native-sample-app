 @exception AWSDKErrorCodeInvalidEmail                                  Email address is invalid.
 @exception AWSDKErrorCodeValidationEmailInUse                          Email is already in use.
 @exception AWSDKErrorCodeConsumerTooYoung                              The consumer is too young
 @exception AWSDKErrorCodeConsumerTooOld                                The dependent is too old.
 @exception AWSDKErrorCodeInvalidDemographicData                        One or more properties of the Enrollment Data supplied does not fulfill requirements.

 @discussion
 When enrollConsumerWithForm is successful the NSError object passed into the completion block will be nil. This means no error has occurred and the user or dependent has been enrolled. If the error
 object is not null we can examine its code and userInfo properties to see what happened.

 Errors can be caught in the client when the form and its contents are validated, or on server.  The demographic data that is checked
 include the address, city, state, zip, date of birth, email, first name, last name, password, state of legal residence, and whether the privacy policy has been accepted. If the error is detected on
 the client the code property of the NSError object will be set to AWSDKErrorCodeInvalidDemographicData, and the userInfo dictionary will describe the fields that were invalid. The
 AWSDKValidationErrorsKey maps an item in the userInfo to field names and corresponding error codes that describe the validation failure(s). Additionally NSLocalizedDescription,
 NSLocalizedFailureReason and NSLocalizedRecoverySuggestion may be set.

 For server side errors the code property will vary based on the the server response, and the userInfo dictionary describes the failure. For example a server side error might be insuffcient password
 complexity. The telehealth platform has certain configurable requirements on password complexity. If the password is invalid an error with a AWSDKErrorCodeInvalidValue code will be returned. This
 error will have the password requirements as the NSLocalizedRecoveryOptionsErrorKey. The entries in the userInfo vary depending on the server side error.

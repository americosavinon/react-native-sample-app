/**
 A forced transfer for a visit when the provider declines the visit suggests a new transfer.

 @discussion The previous visit ends and the provider suggests a transfer to another provider. The consumer can decide to accept the transfer by calling the super class method [AWSDKVisitTransfer
 acceptTransfer:] , or decline the transfer where no call is necessary because the previous visit has already ended. If the consumer accepts, they are presented with either a new AWSDKVisitContext or
 AWSDKVisit depending if quick transfer is supported. See [AWSDKVisitTransfer acceptTransfer:] for more details.

 @since 2.1.0

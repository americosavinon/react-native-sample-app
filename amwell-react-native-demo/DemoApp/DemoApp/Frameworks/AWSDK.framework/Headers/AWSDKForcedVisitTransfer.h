/**
 A forced transfer for a visit when the provider either declines the visit and suggests a new transfer, or when a provider wants to perform a warm transfer.

 @discussion The previous visit ends and the provider suggests a transfer to another provider. The consumer can decide to accept the transfer by calling the super class method [AWSDKVisitTransfer
 acceptTransfer:] , or decline the transfer where no call is necessary because the previous visit has already ended. If the consumer accepts, they are presented with either a new AWSDKVisitContext or
 AWSDKVisit depending if quick transfer is supported. See [AWSDKVisitTransfer acceptTransfer:] for more details. In the case of a warm transfer, the consumer has already had a video visit with the
 provider and will be transferred to a new provider after the visit ends.
